        title: "KARMA IS DEAD",
        trackPosition: 1,
        writtenBy: "Holvast",
        lyrics: `
Let me ask you brother, do you know what it's like
When everybody's driving monster trucks and you're riding a bike
Did you ever get the feeling, you're swimming against the tide
And everybody else is just enjoying the ride
---
Let me tell you brother, well Karma is dead
If it ever was alive, so get it out of your head 
---
And you know it doesn't matter, because anything you do
Doesn't tally anywhere, it's only for you
There's no soul currency, sitting in a vault
For you to draw down every time you're at fault
Bad deeds don't get punished, there's no reward for good
No scheming calculations, running under the hood
No pearly gates of judgement, no final bill to pay
So if you wanna do something, do it anyway
---
Sister can't you see it? Life just isn't fair
Until you understand that, you can't go anywhere
Did you ever ask yourself why things were happening to you
Don't you know that all those things happen to me too
---
Let me tell you sister, well Karma is dead
If it ever was alive, so get it out of your head 
---
And you know it doesn't matter, because anything you do
Doesn't tally anywhere, it's only for you
There's no soul currency, sitting in a vault
For you to draw down every time you're at fault
Bad deeds don't get punished, there's no reward for good
No scheming calculations, running under the hood
No pearly gates of judgement, no final bill to pay
So if you wanna do something, do it anyway
---
Leaders are you leading, or sleeping at the wheel?
Tripping on the workers crushed under your heel
Did you ever stop to wonder just what side you're on
I guess when you're winning it's hard to think you're wrong
---
And you know it doesn't matter, because anything you do
Doesn't tally anywhere, it's only for you
There's no soul currency, sitting in a vault
For you to draw down every time you're at fault
Bad deeds don't get punished, there's no reward for good
No scheming calculations, running under the hood
No pearly gates of judgement, no final bill to pay
So if you wanna do something, do it anyway
---
Don't give me your prejudices, I've got my own
My god! You're like a dog with a bone!
Don't you drag me down with you, give me a break
My god! Is there anything you won't take?
---
I used to think that things had to be done in the right way
But now I just do whatever gets me through the day
You say I'm sacrificing the things that made me me
Let me tell you darling that's the way it's got to be
---
I'm looking in the mirror, I see karma is dead
If it ever was alive, even just in my head

        writtenBy: "Holvast",
        lyrics: `
You always tell me less is more
When I'm knocking at your door
Never knew what that meant before
I guess I better learn
---
You tell me love is never real
So what's this thing I feel
I've got wounds that will never heal
I guess it's not just me
---
So less is more, just when you say?
I guess you're used to it being that way
You let me in, with a smile
Say you love me once in a while
As you show me out the door
You remind me that less is more
---
I always thought you'd come around
When I was lost it was you I found
But you left without a sound
I guess I should have known
---
So less is more, just when you say?
I guess you're used to it being that way
You let me in, with a smile
Say you love me once in a while
As you show me out the door
You remind me that less is more

So less is more, just when you say?
I guess you're used to it being that way
You let me in, with a smile
Say you love me once in a while

You remind me that less is more

        trackPosition: 2,
        lyrics: `
I remember you when you when you were twenty four
I remember you before
I remember you when you were in my band
Way before you turned so grand
You were always hiding, sitting at the back
Leaning up against the stack
You couldn't play your bass, you couldn't play guitar
How did you become a star
---
It's a crying shame
But maybe that's the price of fa-a-ame
Close your eyes
And maybe you'll start to see
---
I saw you a few years back, walking in the street
Thinking you were so elite
You strutted like a peacock, colours all on show
People bathing in your glow
You didn't recognise me, you just stared straight through
If only they knew what I knew
You didn't recognise me, all that we've been through
Tell me who the fuck are you
---
It's a crying shame
But maybe that's the price of fa-a-ame
Close your eyes
And maybe you'll start to see
---
It's a crying shame
That you can't remember my na-a-ame
Close your eyes
And maybe you'll start to see
---
It's a crying shame
That you can't remember my na-a-ame
Close your eyes
And maybe you'll start to see

        lyrics: `
I can hear you breathing
I can feel you grieving
You're feeling so co-o-old
Your feelings unfold
I got you on my mind
I'm trying to be kind
You feel so fa-a-ar
Away from my arms
---
You say
No way
I can't do this any more
---
It's four in the morning and we're talking about
How to make it through another endless night
You hold my hand and then it brings me back to you
---
You look so helpless
You look so broke
I try to digest
The words you spoke
We lie up all night
You can't explain
You used up all your fi-i-ight
You can't contain

You say
No way
I can't do this any more
---
It's four in the morning and we're talking about
How to make it through another endless night
You hold my hand and then it brings me back to you
---
It's like I go to pieces every time you say
You can't remember being any other way
You hold my hand and then it brings me back to you
---
It's four in the morning and we're talking about
How to make it through another endless night
You hold my hand and then it brings me back to you

        trackPosition: 5,
        writtenBy: "Holvast",
        lyrics: `
You sold your body, just about gave it away
To the first suitor, that promised he would stay
And guess what happened he was gone before the dawn
Some things you wish you knew, the moment you were born
But you were ready, the second time around
The price was higher, you stood your ground
And so you came to learn, that everything has a cost
The one who doesn't win, has always lost
---
You sold your car, it was a gift from your old man
You didn't mean to, it wasn't in the plan
A blue Camaro, nineteen sixty-nine
With white go faster stripes, damn that car was fine
And how you loved it, it reminded you of him
Until that guy in L.A., opened up his wallet with a grin
And so that memory of picking up the keys
Disappeared faster than that car into the breeze
---
So sell your soul, sell your soul
It's the last thing left to go
Sell your soul, sell your soul
Bidders welcome high and low
Sell your soul, let it roll
Dig yourself out of that hole
Flash your cash, one mad dash
It's just a soul what's the worst that could happen?
---
You sold your image, for just a thousand words
And was it worth it? The lines are getting blurred
And now you see yourself as someone else's pet
And in the long run, what did you really get?
---
So sell your soul, sell your soul
It's the last thing left to go
Sell your soul, sell your soul
Bidders welcome high and low
Sell your soul, let it roll
Dig yourself out of that hole
Flash your cash, one mad dash
It's just a soul what's the worst that could happen?
---
You sold it all, and now you want it back
But you might find, the mirror can't uncrack
---
What's to be done?
Live like you're on the run
What's left to sell?
Well since you're going to hell...
---
Sell your soul, sell your soul
It's the last thing left to go
Sell your soul, sell your soul
Bidders welcome high and low
Sell your soul, let it roll
Dig yourself out of that hole
Flash your cash, one mad dash
It's just a soul what's the worst that could happen?

[Verse 1]
   Bm             D
As I drift into a sleep
   Bm                 E
An old man stares at me
He calls me into his room
And tells me about a tree
Long flowing willow leaves
Hanging above a lake
Secrets are hidden deep
Plunder is left to take
---
Sounds from out of sight
It's a bitter twisted night
You already know when you're
gonna have to fight
Sounds from out of sight
It's a bitter twisted night
You already know when you're gone
---
I set out to find the tree
But all I can see is night
Dark fingers pull at me
Sharp teeth begin to bite
Figures appear everywhere
Halting me in my path
A dark power  pulls me down
And I know I'll feel his wrath 
---
Sounds from out of sight
It's a bitter twisted night
You already know when you're
gonna have to fight
Sounds from out of sight
It's a bitter twisted night
You already know when you're gone
---
I'm feeling ecstasy
I'm on my way back home
I know I'm going to see
Some people of my own
Old man who burdened me
He has been left behind
Outsiders start to flee
Vengeance is on my mind
---
Sounds from out of sight
It's a bitter twisted night
You already know when you're
gonna have to fight
Sounds from out of sight
It's a bitter twisted night
You already know when you're gone
---
Sounds from out of sight
It's a bitter twisted night
You already know when you're
gonna have to fight
Sounds from out of sight
It's a bitter twisted night
You already know when you're gone
