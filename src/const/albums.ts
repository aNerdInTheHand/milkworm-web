        trackPosition: 1,
        writtenBy: "Holvast",
        lyrics: `
Let me ask you brother, do you know what it's like
When everybody's driving monster trucks and you're riding a bike
Did you ever get the feeling, you're swimming against the tide
And everybody else is just enjoying the ride
---
Let me tell you brother, well Karma is dead
If it ever was alive, so get it out of your head 
---
And you know it doesn't matter, because anything you do
Doesn't tally anywhere, it's only for you
There's no soul currency, sitting in a vault
For you to draw down every time you're at fault
Bad deeds don't get punished, there's no reward for good
No scheming calculations, running under the hood
No pearly gates of judgement, no final bill to pay
So if you wanna do something, do it anyway
---
Sister can't you see it? Life just isn't fair
Until you understand that, you can't go anywhere
Did you ever ask yourself why things were happening to you
Don't you know that all those things happen to me too
---
Let me tell you sister, well Karma is dead
If it ever was alive, so get it out of your head 
---
And you know it doesn't matter, because anything you do
Doesn't tally anywhere, it's only for you
There's no soul currency, sitting in a vault
For you to draw down every time you're at fault
Bad deeds don't get punished, there's no reward for good
No scheming calculations, running under the hood
No pearly gates of judgement, no final bill to pay
So if you wanna do something, do it anyway
---
Leaders are you leading, or sleeping at the wheel?
Tripping on the workers crushed under your heel
Did you ever stop to wonder just what side you're on
I guess when you're winning it's hard to think you're wrong
---
And you know it doesn't matter, because anything you do
Doesn't tally anywhere, it's only for you
There's no soul currency, sitting in a vault
For you to draw down every time you're at fault
Bad deeds don't get punished, there's no reward for good
No scheming calculations, running under the hood
No pearly gates of judgement, no final bill to pay
So if you wanna do something, do it anyway
---
Don't give me your prejudices, I've got my own
My god! You're like a dog with a bone!
Don't you drag me down with you, give me a break
My god! Is there anything you won't take?
---
I used to think that things had to be done in the right way
But now I just do whatever gets me through the day
You say I'm sacrificing the things that made me me
Let me tell you darling that's the way it's got to be
---
I'm looking in the mirror, I see karma is dead
If it ever was alive, even just in my head

You always tell me less is more
When I'm knocking at your door
Never knew what that meant before
I guess I better learn
---
You tell me love is never real
So what's this thing I feel
I've got wounds that will never heal
I guess it's not just me
---
So less is more, just when you say?
I guess you're used to it being that way
You let me in, with a smile
Say you love me once in a while
As you show me out the door
You remind me that less is more
---
I always thought you'd come around
When I was lost it was you I found
But you left without a sound
I guess I should have known

So less is more, just when you say?
I guess you're used to it being that way
You let me in, with a smile
Say you love me once in a while

You remind me that less is more

        lyrics: `
I remember you when you when you were twenty four
I remember you before
I remember you when you were in my band
Way before you turned so grand
You were always hiding, sitting at the back
Leaning up against the stack
You couldn't play your bass, you couldn't play guitar
How did you become a star
---
It's a crying shame
But maybe that's the price of fame
Close your eyes
And maybe you'll start to see
---
I saw you a few years back, walking in the street
Thinking you were so elite
You strutted like a peacock, colours all on show
People bathing in your glow
You didn't recognise me, you just stared straight through
If only they knew what I knew
You didn't recognise me, all that we've been through
Tell me who the fuck are you
---
It's a crying shame
But maybe that's the price of fame
Close your eyes
And maybe you'll start to see
---
It's a crying shame
That you can't remember my name
Close your eyes
And maybe you'll start to see
---
It's a crying shame
That you can't remember my name
Close your eyes
And maybe you'll start to see

I can hear you breathing
I can feel you grieving
You're feeling so cold
Your feelings unfold
I got you on my mind
I'm trying to be kind
You feel so far
Away from my arms

You say
No way
I can't do this any more

It's four in the morning and we're talking about
How to make it through another endless night
You hold my hand and then it brings me back to you

You look so helpless
You look so broke
I try to digest
The words you spoke
We lie up all night
You can't explain
You used up all your fight
You can't contain

You say
No way
I can't do this any more

It's four in the morning and we're talking about
How to make it through another endless night
You hold my hand and then it brings me back to you

It's like I go to pieces every time you say
You can't remember being any other way
You hold my hand and then it brings me back to you

        writtenBy: "Holvast",
        lyrics: `
You sold your body, just about gave it away
To the first suitor, that promised he would stay
And guess what happened he was gone before the dawn
Some things you wish you knew, the moment you were born
But you were ready, the second time around
The price was higher, you stood your ground
And so you came to learn, that everything has a cost
The one who doesn't win, has always lost
---
You sold your car, it was a gift from your old man
You didn't mean to, it wasn't in the plan
A blue Camaro, nineteen sixty-nine
With white go faster stripes, damn that car was fine
And how you loved it, it reminded you of him
Until that guy in L.A., opened up his wallet with a grin
And so that memory of picking up the keys
Disappeared faster than that car into the breeze
---
So sell your soul, sell your soul
It's the last thing left to go
Sell your soul, sell your soul
Bidders welcome high and low
Sell your soul, let it roll
Dig yourself out of that hole
Flash your cash, one mad dash
It's just a soul what's the worst that could happen?
---
You sold your image, for just a thousand words
And was it worth it? The lines are getting blurred
And now you see yourself as someone else's pet
And in the long run, what did you really get?
---
So sell your soul, sell your soul
It's the last thing left to go
Sell your soul, sell your soul
Bidders welcome high and low
Sell your soul, let it roll
Dig yourself out of that hole
Flash your cash, one mad dash
It's just a soul what's the worst that could happen?
---
You sold it all, and now you want it back
But you might find, the mirror can't uncrack
---
What's to be done?
Live like you're on the run
What's left to sell?
Well since you're going to hell...
---
Sell your soul, sell your soul
It's the last thing left to go
Sell your soul, sell your soul
Bidders welcome high and low
Sell your soul, let it roll
Dig yourself out of that hole
Flash your cash, one mad dash
It's just a soul what's the worst that could happen?

[Verse 1]
   Bm             D
As I drift into a sleep
   Bm                 E
An old man stares at me
He calls me into his room
And tells me about a tree
Long flowing willow leaves
Hanging above a lake
Secrets are hidden deep
Plunder is left to take
---
Sounds from out of sight
It's a bitter twisted night
You already know when you're
gonna have to fight
Sounds from out of sight
It's a bitter twisted night
You already know when you're gone
---
I set out to find the tree
But all I can see is night
Dark fingers pull at me
Sharp teeth begin to bite
Figures appear everywhere
Halting me in my path
A dark power  pulls me down
And I know I'll feel his wrath 
---
Sounds from out of sight
It's a bitter twisted night
You already know when you're
gonna have to fight
Sounds from out of sight
It's a bitter twisted night
You already know when you're gone

I'm feeling ecstasy
I'm on my way back home
I know I'm going to see
Some people of my own
Old man who burdened me
He has been left behind
Outsiders start to flee
Vengeance is on my mind
---
Sounds from out of sight
It's a bitter twisted night
You already know when you're
gonna have to fight
Sounds from out of sight
It's a bitter twisted night
You already know when you're gone

It's a shame
Insane
The way you're talking like you're gonna move around and around
It's the same
In name
And it's always been the same old way

It's a crime
Sublime
The way you take it and you keep it and you're hiding it all
All the ti-ime
You cli-imb
And your sidekick starts to shine

Oh when you told me that's how you feel
Oh when you told me love isn't real

Oh when you told me that's how you feel
Oh when you told me love isn't real

Walk away
You say
Because you're leaving at the end of the day no matter what
I say
And I pray
That you're never coming back this time

You're gone
So long
I didn't think that I could be on my own every day 
For good
I could
I could think about it every night

You talk about it like it's all the same
You don't get why it's a crying shame 
You can't feel it getting under your wings
You don't appreciate the finer things
You like to go out in your fancy shoes
But you don't realise you're missing the blues
If you can last a second without your heels
I can show you how nirvana feels
---
From the edge of the sea
To the mountains and snow
You can take it with you everywhere you go
In the glorious sun
Or in the pouring rain
There's music running through your veins
---
I hear the hum when I plug in the jack
I feel it hit me like a heart attack
The chords ring out like a roaring beast
It's a moving pentatonic minor ear feast
Euphoric bliss rushes over the crowd
The only way to listen is to turn up loud
I couldn't live if I didn't have rock
Don't need the roll, if I had to stop
---
From the edge of the sea
To the mountains of snow
To the mountains of snow
You can take it with you everywhere you go
In the light of the day
And in the dark of the night
You can feel the rhythm when you're out of sight
---
When you're out in the woods 
In the cradle of fear
You can hear the melody with nobody near
In the glorious sun
Or in the pouring rain
There's music running through your veins

From the edge of the sea
To the mountains of snow
To the mountains of snow
You can take it with you everywhere you go
In the light of the day

Pretty as a picture, on someone else's wall
He'd hang you up, just to watch you fall
Singing like a songbird, for nobody to hear

Call it what it is it's just another dream out of range

Pretty little dreamer, wishing it away
He'll let you know, just what to say
Pretty as a picture, anyone can see
She's not for hanging up, gotta set her free

And why did you think that a man like him could change

Even though she needed to fall

I used to have a singer
Every day I'd ring her on the telephone
I'd give her an idea
Then go and get a beer while she made it her own

That girl could really wail
She put the wind into my sail and the wood on my fire
One day I up and told her
That I really had to hold her 'cause she was my one true desire

Make music, make love
Isn't it all just the same
Like a word from above
Over and over and over again
Make music, all around
In the light and the dark and the sun and the rain
Like a wheel turning round
Over and over and over again

I was her guitarist
She thought I was an artist when I wrote her a song
I wrote her every day
And she asked if I would play while she sang along

She didn't like my lyrics
She wanted to be in it so I tried again
I never had a muse
That I couldn't stand to lose I couldn't bear the pain

Like a word from above

Out of love
Out of time
Losing you
Losing my mind

She didn't need to hear me
Like I needed her right near me so she walked out the door
And now I make my music
Somewhere no-one can refuse it any more
